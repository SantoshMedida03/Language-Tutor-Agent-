## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10+
*   Node.js and npm
*   PostgreSQL server running locally

### 1. Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the root of the `Language tutor` directory.
    *   Copy the contents of `.env.example` into your new `.env` file.
    *   Fill in the required values:
        *   `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your API key from Google AI Studio.
        *   `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection string (e.g., `postgresql://user:password@localhost/Language_Tutor`).
        *   `SECRET_KEY`: A long, random string for JWT signing.
        *   `ALGORITHM`: Should be `HS256`.
        *   `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`: Set to `30`.

5.  **Create the PostgreSQL database:**
    *   Connect to your PostgreSQL server.
    *   Run the following SQL command (make sure the database name matches the one in your `DATABASE_URL`):

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install JavaScript dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
